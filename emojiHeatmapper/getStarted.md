#### emojiHeatmapper app gives us data about usage of emoticons on twitter.

The app visualises the collected location information from tweets as points
on a **map**.

#### How to use the app

On launching the app the user is presented with the search bar and an empty
map. When the user enters the emoji in the search bar, then points appears on
the map according to the location tracked from the tweets. If in case instead of
emoji if the user enters text, then an alert message gets popped up.

The users can also zoom in the map to find the exact location of the tweet post.
