#### emojiHeatmapper app gives us data about usage of emoticons on twitter.

The app visualises the collected emoji posts location information from tweets by
rendering the emoji on a **map**, here the emoji getting rendered on the map is
the search query.

#### How to use the app

On launching the app the user is presented with the search bar, an emoji icon which
displays list of emojis and an empty map. When the user enters the emoji in the
search bar or selects one from the list, then the emoji i.e., the search query entered
by the user appears on the map according to the location tracked from the tweets. If in
case instead of emoji if the user enters text, then an alert message gets popped up.

The users can also zoom in the map to find the exact location of the tweet post.
