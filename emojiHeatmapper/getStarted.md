#### emojiHeatmapper app gives us data about usage of emoticons on twitter.

The app visualises the collected location information from tweets as points
on a **map**.

#### How to use the app

On launching the app the user is presented with the search bar and a empty
map. When the user enters the emoji, then the points appear on the map as per the
usage of that particular emoji in twitter.

The users can also zoom in the map to find the exact location of the tweet post.
